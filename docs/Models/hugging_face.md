# ðŸ¤— HuggingFace

## Introduction
This class provides the `HuggingFace` model setup, which is a wrapper for the `ChatHuggingFace` class. It is used for `HuggingFace` models. It provides default configuration and could be extended with additional methods if needed.

The implementation of the class is in this [link](https://github.com/VinciGit00/Scrapegraph-ai/blob/main/scrapegraphai/models/hugging_face.py).
