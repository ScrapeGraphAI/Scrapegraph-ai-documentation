This class provides the `Groq` model setup, which is a wrapper for the `ChatGroq` class. It is used for `Groq` models. It provides default configuration and could be extended with additional methods if needed.

The implementation of the class is in this [link](https://github.com/VinciGit00/Scrapegraph-ai/blob/main/scrapegraphai/models/groq.py).
