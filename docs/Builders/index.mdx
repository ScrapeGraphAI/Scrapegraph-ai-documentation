In the standard structure of `Scrapegraph-ai`, a graph is composed of nodes,
each with its own functionality. [`GraphBuilder`](/docs/Builders/GraphBuilder)
is a dynamic tool for constructing web scraping graphs based on user prompts.
It utilizes a natural language understanding model to interpret user prompts and
automatically generates a graph configuration for scraping web content.
