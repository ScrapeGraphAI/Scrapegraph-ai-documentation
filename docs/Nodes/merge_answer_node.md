# MergeAnswersNode Module

The `MergeAnswersNode` module implements a node responsible for merging the answers from multiple graph instances into a single answer.

## Classes

### `MergeAnswersNode`

`MergeAnswersNode` is a node responsible for merging the answers from multiple graph instances into a single answer.

#### Attributes

- **llm_model**: An instance of a language model client, configured for generating answers.
- **verbose (bool)**: A flag indicating whether to show print statements during execution.

#### Methods

- **`__init__(self, input: str, output: List[str], node_config: Optional[dict] = None, node_name: str = "MergeAnswers")`**
  - Initializes the `MergeAnswersNode` with a language model client and a node name.
  - **Args**:
    - `input (str)`: Boolean expression defining the input keys needed from the state.
    - `output (List[str])`: List of output keys to be updated in the state.
    - `node_config (dict, optional)`: Additional configuration for the node. Defaults to None.
    - `node_name (str, optional)`: The unique identifier name for the node. Defaults to "MergeAnswers".

- **`execute(self, state: dict) -> dict`**
  - Executes the node's logic to merge the answers from multiple graph instances into a single answer.
  - **Args**:
    - `state (dict)`: The current state of the graph. The input keys will be used to fetch the correct data from the state.
  - **Returns**:
    - `dict`: The updated state with the output key containing the generated answer.

#### Example Usage

Here is an example of how to use the `MergeAnswersNode` class:

```python
from merge_answers_node import MergeAnswersNode

# Define a MergeAnswersNode
merge_answers_node = MergeAnswersNode(
    input="user_prompt, website_contents",
    output=["merged_answer"],
    node_config={"llm_model": llm_model},
    node_name="MergeAnswers"
)

# Define the state
state = {
    "user_prompt": "What are the advantages of renewable energy?",
    "website_contents": ["Advantages of renewable energy: ...", "Renewable energy is beneficial because ..."],
}

# Execute the MergeAnswersNode
state = merge_answers_node.execute(state)

# Retrieve the merged answer from the state
merged_answer = state["merged_answer"]

print(f"Merged Answer: {merged_answer}")
