# üöÅ ImageToTextNode

## Introduction
The `ImageToTextNode` is a fundamental component within Scrapegraph-ai, designed to process an image and return its text description. This node leverages an instance of the `OpenAIImageToText` class to extract text from images, contributing to the extraction and interpretation of information from visual content.

The implementation of the class is in this [link](https://github.com/VinciGit00/Scrapegraph-ai/blob/main/scrapegraphai/nodes/image_to_text_node.py)

## Implementation
```python reference title="ImageToTextNode"
