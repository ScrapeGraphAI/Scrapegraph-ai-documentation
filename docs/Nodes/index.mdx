# ðŸª¢ Nodes

In the standard structure of `Scrapegraph-ai`, a graph is composed of nodes,
each with its own functionality. The main nodes of this library include:

- [`BaseNode`](/docs/Nodes/base_node): an abstract class from which all nodes derive.
- [`ConditionalNode`](/docs/Nodes/conditional_node): creates conditional branches.
- [`FetchHtmlNode`](/docs/Nodes/fetch_node): performs`HTML requests.
- [`GenerateAnswerNode`](/docs/Nodes/generate_answer_node): generates an answer using a language model (LLM) based on
the user's input and the content extracted from a webpage.
- [`GetProbableTagsNode`](/docs/Nodes/get_probable_tags_node): utilizes a language model to identify probable HTML tags
within a document that are likely to contain information relevant to a user's
query.
- [`ImageToTextNode`](/docs/Nodes/image_to_text_node): given an image, retrieves the text.
- [`TextToSpeechNode`](/docs/Nodes/text_to_speech_node): given text, saves it as an .mp3 file.
