# Nodes

In the standard structure of `Scrapegraph-ai`, a graph is composed of nodes,
each with its own functionality. The main nodes of this library include:

- `BaseNode`: an abstract class from which all nodes derive.
- `ConditionalNode`: creates conditional branches.
- `FetchHtmlNode`: performs`HTML requests.
- `GenerateAnswerNode`: generates an answer using a language model (LLM) based on
the user's input and the content extracted from a webpage.
- `GetProbableTagsNode`: utilizes a language model to identify probable HTML tags
within a document that are likely to contain information relevant to a user's
query.
- `ImageToTextNode`: given an image, retrieves the text.
- `TextToSpeechNode`: given text, saves it as an .mp3 file.
