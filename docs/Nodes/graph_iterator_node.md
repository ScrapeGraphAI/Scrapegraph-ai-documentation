# ðŸ“Š GraphIteratorNode

## Introduction
The `GraphIteratorNode` class models a node responsible for instantiating and running multiple graph instances in parallel. It creates as many graph instances as the number of elements in the input list.

The implementation of the class is in this [link](https://github.com/VinciGit00/Scrapegraph-ai/blob/main/scrapegraphai/nodes/graph_iterator_node.py).
