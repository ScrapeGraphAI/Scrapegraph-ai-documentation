# üó£Ô∏è ConditionalNode

## Introduction
The `ConditionalNode` class implements a node for determining the next step in a graph's execution flow based on the presence and content of a specified key in the graph's state. This node type facilitates branching logic within the graph, allowing for dynamic paths based on the data available in the current state.

The implementation of the class is in this [link](https://github.com/VinciGit00/Scrapegraph-ai/blob/main/scrapegraphai/nodes/conditional_node.py).

## Implementation
