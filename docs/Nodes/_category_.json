    "description": "In the standard structure of Scrapegraph-ai, a graph is composed of nodes, each with its own functionality. The principal nodes of this library include: \n\n- base_node: an abstract class from which all nodes derive. \n- conditional_node: creates conditional branches. \n- fetch_html_node: performs HTML requests. \n- generate_answer_node: generates an answer using a language model (LLM) based on the user's input and the content extracted from a webpage. \n- get_probable_tags_node: utilizes a language model to identify probable HTML tags within a document that are likely to contain information relevant to a user's query. \n- image_to_text_node: given an image, retrieves the text. \n- text_to_speech_node: given text, saves it as an .mp3 file."
