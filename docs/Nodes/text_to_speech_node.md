# ðŸ”¥ TextToSpeechNode

## Introduction
The `TextToSpeechNode` is a critical component within Scrapegraph-ai, responsible for processing text and returning the corresponding voice output. This node utilizes an instance of the `OpenAITextToSpeech` class to convert text into speech, enabling the generation of audio responses based on textual input.

The implementation of the class is in this [link](https://github.com/VinciGit00/Scrapegraph-ai/blob/main/scrapegraphai/nodes/text_to_speech_node.py).

## Implementation
