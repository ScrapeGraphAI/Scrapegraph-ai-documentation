# ðŸ˜¼ FetchNode

## Introduction
The `FetchNode` is a crucial component within Scrapegraph-ai responsible for retrieving the HTML content of a specified URL or just text and updating the graph's state with this content. This node serves as an initial step in many scraping workflows, ensuring that the necessary HTML content is available for further processing by subsequent nodes in the graph.

The implementation of the class is in this [link](https://github.com/VinciGit00/Scrapegraph-ai/blob/main/scrapegraphai/nodes/fetch_node.py).
